A simple Python client that describes how to interact with the local, built-in HTTP server inside the Spotify player.

For more information, see my [blog post](http://cgbystrom.com/articles/deconstructing-spotifys-builtin-http-server/) describing more details.

Python (or I) seems to have problems understanding SSL and the certicates. In order to make the project work, I had to disable certificate verification.

While not the end of the world, it results in constant error messages.
